# NFL-Icing-the-Kicker
R code for cleaning and scrapping data from the NFL website. Is icing NFL kicker's worth it?

This project wanted to answer if icing NFL kickers was beneficial to the defensive team.
The data was collected by scrapping every single play by play from 2009 (? I dont remember, check code) to 2015.
I sorted through the data to find cases where the defensive team took a timeout when the kicking team is already on the field ready to kick a field goal.
